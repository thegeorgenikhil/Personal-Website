                If you have started learning any type of development it is very unlikely that you haven't come across "Git" and "Github" or you may even think both of them are the sameðŸ˜‰.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                In the beginning, I also thought both of them were the same :) As I started learning about Git and Github, it was very difficult as to what they are exactly and why they are being used in the first case. That is exactly what I going to break down in this blog post.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                Okay let be just give you a basic description of what these two are, then we will go deeper into both.
            </p>


            <h2 class="blog-sub-heading">1.Git</h2>
            <p class="blog-text">
                Git is basically what you call a version control system. A version control system is a system that records all changes that have been made in a file so that after every major change that you have made in your code you can "commit" them. It is just a file that is present on your machine that just takes note of all changes you are making to your code. It is done so that if in any case, your code breaks you always have the option to go to the previous stable version. Also if you are working in a team you can see what all changes have been made by others.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-text">
                But the problem is, all this time Git is stored only in your machine. What if others want to see those changes in case you are working in a group or what if you decide to change your machine tomorrow? That is when Github come to the picture.
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-sub-heading">2.Github</h2>
            <p class="blog-text">
                Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. Github is where you can host all your code and also let others see your code. If ever your laptop breaks or you are on someone else computer and want to access your code files, you can easily do that by fetching all your files from Github.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                It also allows you to collab with anyone in the world, meaning if you and your dev friend want to do a project together you can do that using Github. The other person can modify or add to your code. And by using the power of Git you can see what all changes have been made by the other person in each version. You can also use Git to "download" all the code that your co-worker added, to your machine and start working on it right away!
            </p>

                Working of Git
            </h2>
            <p class="blog-text">
                Now let us look at the working of Git.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                Firstly, you have to add some file/code in your <strong>working copy</strong> which is basically where you write all the code, modify them, add a file, etc which is mostly your code editor. It is called working copy as it is on which you are currently working and all the changes are made in that working copy only.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                Now secondly, you have to add those files/changes made to the <strong>staging area</strong>. As the name suggests you just copy those changes to the stage where you get to pick what all changes are to be added to the local repository. Think of it as a draft before publishing a blog. You can decide what all paragraphs are going into the final version and edit them. In the staging area, you can choose the changes and then commit them to the local repository.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                Committing means adding all your code and changes made to the <strong>local repository</strong> which is a file on your machine. It now acts as a folder to store all your changes. A repository is just a folder where all the files in a particular project are stored together.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                Now that we have all our code and changes made in the local repo, we can now push it to the remote repo, which in our case is Github. By pushing our code from our local machine to Github we can store our code in the cloud and let anyone in the world see our code.

            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                So now anyone with a Github account can access our code, copy it to their machine and start working together on the project with us. Like in the above we can push each of our changes to Github and let our dev friend get that code in their machine in real-time.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                That is mostly about what Git and Github are. I hope this blog helped you get some more clarity about them.
            </p>
